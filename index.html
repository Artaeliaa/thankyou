            <h2>Personal Coded Thank You Website</h2>
            <br>
            <p>To all who helped me get to this day, the TeenTurnship experience with Dell Technologies was out of this world.</p>
            <br> 
            <p>Thanks to Dell and the inspirational stories from all the interns and employees and their passion for what they do daily, I've found my own. Initially, I would've thought of myself as an artsy person and I would've created a large handmade <i>"Thank You"</i> card to hand to you all. However, thanks to my eye opening experience in Dell, I have instead found myself wanting to go an extra mile by coding a website to thank you all instead!</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I was coding this website, I got a great kick out of it and had plenty of <i>"Aha"</i>, <i>"So that's the way you do it!"</i> and <i>"My mind is blown!"</i> moments.</p>

            <h2>Impressions</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for opening my eyes. Here are some thoughts from my blog about my experience in Dell Technologies.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b><i>"Being in the lab was a mind-blowing experience, one that I can say with absolute confidence has finally allowed me to dream. I now know exactly what I want to do in my life, where I want to be in 5-10 years time. I know I want to be apart of a team with these like-minded, brilliant people and I know I want to play a role in helping technology shape our futures and improve quality of life, for everyone.</i></b></p>
            <br>
            <p><b><i>"It was truly a wondrous experience that has just blown open my eyes to the unbelievable realm of possibilities technology (and Dell) have to offer. If someone asks now what I’d like to do in the future, it’s being able to have a part in creating and advancing technology. I want to see the change. I want to be one of the reasons behind that change."</i></b></p>
            <br>
            <p><b><i>"I was directionless. Before this whole TeenTurnship, I was honestly fearful. Thanks to today though, I finally, finally found something that’s ignited that “burning passion” in me. I can see a brightly lit path now. Today is the day my future's been defined and made clear, all thanks to Dell."</i></b></p>
